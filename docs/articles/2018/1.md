## Abstract

This paper examines the impact of a national cash transfer program on labor 
supply in Iran. In 2011, Iran started monthly deposits of cash into individual 
accounts covering more than 70 million people and amounting to 28% of the 
median per capita household income. The payments were compensation for the 
sudden removal of hefty energy subsidies. The program has been heavily 
criticized for its disincentive for work, especially for the poor. We use 
panel data to study the causal effect of the transfers on labor supply using 
exogenous variation in the time households first started receiving transfers 
and in the intensity of treatment, which we define as the share of net 
transfers from the program in total per capita household expenditures. We find 
no evidence that cash transfers reduced labor supply, in terms of hours worked 
or labor force participation. To the contrary, we find positive effects on the 
labor supply of women and self-employed men.
