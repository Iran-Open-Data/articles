# Education and the allocation of time of married women in Iran

# Abstract

In the past two decades Iranian women have become much better educated and 
reduced their fertility, by more than two-thirds. However, their participation 
in market work has not increased appreciably. We turn to time-use data to 
better understand the relationship between women’s education and their time 
use, specially time allocated to children and market work. We employ new data 
from a time-use survey of urban households in 2009 and show that education 
affects the time use of married women in predictable ways, increasing their 
time in market work and child education and reducing their time in housework. 
These results indicate that in Iran productivity of women’s education is 
realized in the market as well as at home, in particular in investment in 
children. The fact that more educated women devote more time to market work 
and child education, the two activities that contribute to economic growth, 
challenges the notion prevalent in the conservative policy circles in Iran 
that public resources allocated to women’s education are somehow wasted.
