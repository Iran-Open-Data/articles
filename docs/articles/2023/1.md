## Abstract

Absolute intragenerational income mobility (AIIM), defined as the percentage 
of households with higher income compared to their previous year, is a 
complementary index to aggregate measures such as income per capita and the 
Gini index to show a more detailed picture of an economy. Panel data on 
household income is necessary to estimate AIIM, but it is not usually 
available in developing countries and, in the long run, for most developed 
countries. In this paper, we employ copula modeling and cross-sectional income 
data in a developing country, Iran, and well approximate the mobility 
estimated by panel data for the years 2011â€“2019 and then utilize the copula 
method to extend our estimation backward until 1991. Our findings reveal that 
absolute intragenerational income mobility in Iran for urban households 
fluctuates between 40% and 62%. AIIM is higher for low-income households.
