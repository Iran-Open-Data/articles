In 2011, Iran started monthly deposits of cash into individual  accounts covering more than 70 million people and amounting to 28% of the  median per capita household income. The payments were compensation for the  sudden removal of hefty energy subsidies. The program has been heavily  criticized for its disincentive for work, especially for the poor. We use  panel data to study the causal effect of the transfers on labor supply using  exogenous variation in the time households first started receiving transfers  and in the intensity of treatment, which we define as the share of net  transfers from the program in total per capita household expenditures. We find  no evidence that cash transfers reduced labor supply, in terms of hours worked  or labor force participation. To the contrary, we find positive effects on the  labor supply of women and self-employed men.</p>","tags":["Djavad Salehi-Isfahani","Mohammad H.

However, their participation  in market work has not increased appreciably. We turn to time-use data to  better understand the relationship between women\u2019s education and their time  use, specially time allocated to children and market work. We employ new data  from a time-use survey of urban households in 2009 and show that education  affects the time use of married women in predictable ways, increasing their  time in market work and child education and reducing their time in housework.  These results indicate that in Iran productivity of women\u2019s education is  realized in the market as well as at home, in particular in investment in  children. The fact that more educated women devote more time to market work  and child education, the two activities that contribute to economic growth,  challenges the notion prevalent in the conservative policy circles in Iran  that public resources allocated to women\u2019s education are somehow wasted.</p>","tags":["Djavad Salehi-Isfahani","Sara Taghvatalab"]},{"location":"articles/2023/","title":"2023","text":""},{"location":"articles/2023/#august","title":"August","text":"<p>Absolute intragenerational income mobility in Iran</p>"},{"location":"articles/2023/1/","title":"Absolute intragenerational income mobility in Iran","text":"","tags":["Naser Amanzadeh","Mohammad Sadra Heydari"]},{"location":"articles/2023/1/#abstract","title":"Abstract","text":"<p>Absolute intragenerational income mobility (AIIM), defined as the percentage  of households with higher income compared to their previous year, is a  complementary index to aggregate measures such as income per capita and the  Gini index to show a more detailed picture of an economy. Panel data on  household income is necessary to estimate AIIM, but it is not usually  available in developing countries and, in the long run, for most developed  countries. In this paper, we employ copula modeling and cross-sectional income  data in a developing country, Iran, and well approximate the mobility  estimated by panel data for the years 2011\u20132019 and then utilize the copula  method to extend our estimation backward until 1991. Our findings reveal that  absolute intragenerational income mobility in Iran for urban households  fluctuates between 40% and 62%. AIIM is higher for low-income households.</p>","tags":["Naser Amanzadeh","Mohammad Sadra Heydari"]},{"location":"authors/","title":"Authors","text":""},{"location":"authors/#djavad-salehi-isfahani","title":"Djavad Salehi-Isfahani","text":"<ul> <li>Cash transfers and labor supply: Evidence from a large-scale program in Iran</li> <li>Education and the allocation of time of married women in Iran</li> </ul>"},{"location":"authors/#mohammad-h-mostafavi-dehzooei","title":"Mohammad H.
